# Automatic branch protections for new repos
This organization is a demonstration of how branch protections can be applied to new repositories automatically.

Once a repo is created, a webhook will be sent to an Azure Function App that will apply some standard branch protections to the new repo.

Check out the [README.md](https://github.com/liatrio-tech-challenge/branch-protection-service/blob/main/README.md) for the [main repo](https://github.com/liatrio-tech-challenge/branch-protection-service) to learn more.
